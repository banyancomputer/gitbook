# üßê SP Monitoring Service

We have a binary that runs alongside Boost and Lotus- it enforces permissions, monitors uptime, does the hot storage, and stages data for onboarding to Filecoin at the storage provider side.

TODO: write more about this. Eventually open-source this code and link it here.
