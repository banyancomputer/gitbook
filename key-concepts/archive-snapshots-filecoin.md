# ðŸ§Š Archive Snapshots (Filecoin)

Banyan supports snapshots to Filecoin. Snapshots are important for data integrity and can be used to restore data from a highly secure backup source.&#x20;

You can take snapshots of any drive in Banyan at any time, and archival snapshots are part of any storage plan you have with Banyan.

Currently, you must snapshot data to put it onto Filecoin. We are working on improving this and adding automatic snapshot/lifecycle features.
