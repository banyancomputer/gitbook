# ðŸ˜‰ Third-party Compliance

Banyan is in the process of getting its SOC2 Type 1 certification. Some datacenters that we work with are SOC2 Type 1 certified as well.

We're working on adding more SOC2 Type 2 datacenters to our network, finishing our certification, adding other compliance certifications to our roster, and adding features to filter for compliant SPs.

If you have a lot of data and are interested in Banyan but need compliance questions answered first, don't hesitate to [reach out](https://banyan.computer/contact). We can figure out a custom solution if the fit is right.
