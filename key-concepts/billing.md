# ðŸ’µ Billing

Banyan currently bills via Stripe and accepts payment in USD. Plans can be changed at any time and include several levels: Starter (Free), Lite, Business, and Enterprise. You can find more on our pricing page here:  [https://banyan.computer/pricing](https://banyan.computer/pricing)

If you're storing a very large amount of data, or you need to configure how your replications work (i.e., only hot, only cold, a different number of replications, Filecoin Plus, discounts for very large volumes, or storing with a specific SP), please reach out to the team for custom pricing and solutions.
