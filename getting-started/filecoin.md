# ðŸ“§ Filecoin?

If you want your data to go onto Filecoin, click "snapshot". An archival copy will be backed up. Snapshots are included with all of Banyan's plans.

This functionality will be smoother in the future (e.g. automatic backup and version lifecycle policies)... It's under construction.

#### Filecoin Plus

Banyan doesn't provide full support for Fil+. If you're interested in using Fil+ for your data storage, please contact us through our website. We can support you if you have a good amount of data and can handle getting datacap.
