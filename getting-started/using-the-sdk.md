# ðŸ¦¿ Using the SDK

We have a published version of the [SDK in Rust](https://github.com/banyancomputer/banyanfs) (TypeScript coming soon)

If you're interested in working with Banyan to add decentralized file storage to your app or dapp, please [reach out](https://banyan.computer/contact?hsCtaTracking=7b0968f2-2543-4116-b1e5-32044c0bbcac%7C4110c9f3-af23-47f1-ab5f-9f5a9ff99817) using the form on [our website](https://banyan.computer) so we can get in touch when the SDK is live.
