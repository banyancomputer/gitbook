# ðŸ˜° I just want my data to go on Filecoin!

If you want your data to go onto Filecoin, click "snapshot". An archival copy will be backed up. Snapshots are included with all of Banyan's plans.

This functionality will be smoother in the future (e.g. automatic backup and version lifecycle policies)...&#x20;

### Filecoin Plus

Banyan doesn't currently provide support for Fil+. If you're interested in using Fil+ for your data storage on Banyan, please [contact us](https://banyan.computer/contact) through our website.&#x20;

We can support you if you have a good amount of data and can manage getting datacap. We can also introduce you to notaries and SPs to work with, but we currently don't support shepherding your data through the process.

If you don't know what this is, don't worry about it.
