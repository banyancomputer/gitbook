# ðŸŒ² Welcome to Banyan

## Overview

Banyan is a decentralized file storage platform that encrypts your data at the edge and distributes it to the Banyan network of secure storage providers.

Our cold storage is hosted on [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/), but has the added bonus of Banyan's data maintenance, retrievability and replication, cybersecurity features, SLAs, and our easy-to-use products and clients.

We are the easiest and most reliable way on the market to get your data onto Filecoin- if you want, you can think of us as a very fat usability and reliability layer over the Filecoin network.&#x20;

But, of course, we're also the best way to use decentralized storage in the industry, period.

Manage your data with ease using our various interoperable clients (including Javascript and Rust [BanyanFS](key-concepts/drives-and-banyanfs/) SDKs for use in apps), a Dropbox-like web experience for uploads and data management, a CLI for large-scale uploads, and an S3 API.

Then, access your data, view cryptographic proofs of its storage, audit its cryptographically-signed edit history, and securely collaborate on it with others.
