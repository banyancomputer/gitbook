# ðŸ«  Welcome to Banyan

## Overview

Banyan is a decentralized file storage platform that encrypts your data at the edge and distributes it to the Banyan network of secure storage providers.&#x20;

Our cold storage is on [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/), but has the added bonus of Banyan's data maintenance and replication, cybersecurity features, SLAs, and our easy-to-use products and clients.&#x20;

We are the easiest and most reliable way on the market to get your data onto Filecoin- if you want, you can think of us as a very fat usability and reliability layer over the Filecoin network.

Manage your data with ease using our various interoperable clients, including Javascript and Rust SDKs for use in apps, a Dropbox-like web experience for uploads and data management, a CLI for large-scale uploads, and an S3 API.&#x20;

Then, access your data, view cryptographic proofs of its storage, audit its cryptographically-provable edit history, and share it with collaborators.
